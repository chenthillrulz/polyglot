Study on choice of various components for a web service. 
Aims to quickly give an overview of the various strengths and features of that component/programming language in a [wiki](https://github.com/chenthillrulz/polyglot/wiki).

This project was inspired from  [android guides](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides)


The idea is to create a wiki that serves the following purpose,
* Choosing a database such as SQL, POSTGRES-SQL, Redis, Casandra, memcached, MongoDb etc.
* Choosing a web-framework such as Rails, Sinatra, Play2-Java, Django, Flask, Gin etc.
* Choosing a programming language such as Java, Ruby, Go, Python for building a solution
* Make the syntax/features cheat sheet of a programming language in a single page.
* Choosing a web frontend such as angular js, ember js, backbone js etc.
* Choosing between native/hybrid mobile apps.

List their strengths and possible use cases to build solutions using the right tools.
